# Baking App
*Created as part of Udacity's Android Developer NanoDegree course by Google*

__________________

#### Project Overview

The project goal was to create a Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. The purpose of the app is to list all the baking recipes, and allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
